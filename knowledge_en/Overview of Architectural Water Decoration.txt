Water Supply System

(A) Domestic Water Supply System

Water Source: The water is supplied from two DN300 municipal water mains on Yongxing Road to the north and Longjiang Road to the south. The municipal water pressure is 0.16 MPa.
Water Consumption: The maximum daily water consumption is 284.9 m³/day, and the maximum hourly water consumption is 38.6 m³/hour.
Supply Method: A combined system of direct municipal supply and zoned variable frequency pressurized supply is used.
The south tower's residential units and supporting facilities are supplied by water tanks, variable frequency pumps (1 in use, 1 standby), and a pneumatic tank.
The north tower's commercial and office facilities use a tankless pressure boosting system (mains-superimposed), with pumps configured as 1 in use and 1 standby.
All water supply pumps shall be high-efficiency products that meet the energy-saving evaluation value standards.
The domestic water pump room is located on the B1 level.
Supply Zoning:
South Tower (Residential): Low Zone: -2F to 6F; Mid Zone: 7F to 17F; High Zone: 18F to 21F.
North Tower (Commercial/Office): Mid Zone: 2F to 12F; High Zone: 13F to 16F.
Pressure Control:
To ensure that the static water pressure at consumption points does not exceed 0.20 MPa, adjustable pressure reducing valves are installed on branch pipes on certain floors.
Pressure reducing valves are installed on the branch pipes of the 2F-4F, 8F-10F, and 13F-14F of the north tower, and the 2F-3F, 7F-10F, 13F-15F, and 18F of the south tower, with the post-valve pressure controlled at 0.18 MPa.

An ultraviolet (UV) sterilizer is installed inside the water tank.
Water quality monitoring sampling points are provided for the domestic and direct drinking water systems, and an online monitoring system is planned.
(B) Domestic Hot Water System

Supply Method:
Residential bathrooms use centralized gas-fired wall-hung boilers to produce hot water at a supply temperature of 60°C.
The system employs a full-time mechanical circulation system with two circulation pumps (mutually standby).
Hot Water Consumption:
Residential: Maximum daily hot water consumption is 27.1 m³/day; maximum hourly consumption is 5.36 m³/hour.
Commercial: Maximum daily hot water consumption is 65.7 m³/day; maximum hourly consumption is 12.28 m³/hour.
Circulation Control: The circulation pumps are automatically controlled by a contact-point thermometer on the return pipe, starting at 50°C and stopping at 55°C.
Heating Equipment: The outlet water temperature of the central hot water system's heating equipment shall not exceed 70°C, and the hot water outlet temperature at distribution points shall not be lower than 46°C.
Drainage System

(A) Sewage and Wastewater System

Discharge Method: Indoor sewage and wastewater are discharged separately. Wastewater from areas above the ±0.00 elevation is discharged by gravity into the outdoor pipe network. Sewage and wastewater from areas below the ±0.00 elevation are lifted by submersible sewage pumps before being discharged into the outdoor network.
Discharge Volume: The maximum daily drainage is 256.26 m³/day, and the maximum hourly drainage is 32.56 m³/hour.
Network Connection: The final discharge is into the DN300 municipal combined sewage main on Longjiang Road to the south.
Special Treatment: Wastewater from the underground garage is collected in drainage channels and flows into a collection pit (with grease and sand trapping functions) before being lifted and discharged by submersible pumps. Kitchen wastewater is treated by a grease trap before being discharged into the municipal sewage pipeline.
(B) Rainwater System

Design Standard: Outdoor rainwater is designed for a 5-year return period, while indoor roof rainwater is designed for a 10-year return period.
Collection and Discharge: Roof rainwater is drained using a gravity-flow system with siphonic roof drains (Type 87).
Rainwater Utilization: A portion of the outdoor rainwater, after first-flush diversion, is collected in a rainwater recycling tank in the basement. After treatment processes such as filtration and disinfection, it is used for landscape irrigation and road washing on the site.
Fire Protection System

Fire Water Source: Municipal tap water is used as the fire water source, with a pressure of 0.16 MPa. The system does not have a fire water storage tank and uses fire pumps that boost pressure from the municipal network.
System Overview:
System Name	Design Flow Rate	Duration	Water Supply Method	Total Water Volume per Fire
Outdoor Fire Hydrant	40 L/s	2 h	Direct Municipal Supply	288 m³
Indoor Fire Hydrant (Above Ground)	40 L/s	2 h	Municipal Mains-Boosted	288 m³
Automatic Sprinkler System	50 L/s	1 h	Municipal Mains-Boosted	180 m³

Thermal insulation is required for all hot water and hot water return pipes.
Anti-condensation insulation is required for condensate drain pipes and water supply pipes in humid areas.
The insulation material shall be high-quality closed-cell material, with thickness varying from 20mm to 40mm depending on the pipe diameter.
Pipe Slope: Gravity drainage horizontal pipes must be laid with the specified slope, e.g., a slope of 0.012 for a De110 diameter pipe.
Seismic Design:
Seismic bracing and supports are required for all water supply, drainage, and fire protection piping systems with a diameter of DN65 or greater.
The principle for setting seismic supports is: a maximum transverse spacing of 12 meters and a maximum longitudinal spacing of 24 meters for rigid pipes; spacing is halved for flexible pipes.
The detailed design will be completed by a professional seismic support manufacturer.
Pipe Pressure Testing: Each piping system has specific test pressure requirements. For example, the test pressure for the indoor fire hydrant system is 1.88 MPa, and for the automatic sprinkler system, it is 2.00 MPa.
