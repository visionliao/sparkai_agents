I. Power Supply and Distribution System
Load Classification and Categorization
Tier 1 Load: Fire-fighting equipment (e.g., fire pumps, smoke extraction fans, fire elevators), fire control room, security systems, passenger elevators, public lighting, domestic water pumps, etc.
Tier 2 Load: Electric vehicle charging stations and other general power loads.
Tier 3 Load: Other general electrical loads.
Power Supply
High-Voltage Power: Two 10kV power lines are introduced from the municipal grid. They operate in parallel, with each serving as a backup for the other.
Total Power Capacity: 4000KVA.
Low-Voltage System: The voltage is 220/380V at 50Hz, utilizing a TN-S grounding system.
Substation
Location: A main substation is located on the first basement level.
Transformers: Two SCB12 type energy-efficient dry-type transformers are installed, each with a capacity of 2000KVA and a YNd11 connection group.
Distribution Method: A combination of trunk and radial distribution methods is used.
Power Load Index
Residential: Type A units are designed for 8KW/unit; Type B units are designed for 12KW/unit.
Commercial: Designed for 120W/m².
Office: Designed for 120W/m².
Metering: A main meter is installed at the 10kV power inlet. Sub-metering is implemented for commercial, residential, air conditioning, power, and lighting loads.
II. Cable Laying and Selection
Power Supply for Fire-fighting Equipment:
The main power lines for critical fire-fighting loads such as fire pumps, the fire control room, and smoke extraction equipment shall use fire-resistant cables capable of maintaining power supply for 180 minutes at 950°C.
Fire linkage control circuits, fire alarm bus lines, and evacuation lighting shall use fire-resistant cables capable of maintaining power supply for at least 90 minutes at 750°C.
Laying Method:
Main trunk cables are laid in cable trays.
Lighting branch circuits in the basement are laid in SC20/JDG20 steel conduits, while JDG20 conduits are used in other areas.
When high-voltage and low-voltage cables are laid in the same tray, a metal partition must be installed for separation.
Fireproof Blocking: Cable trays and conduits must be sealed with fireproof materials (such as fireproof mastic or pillows) where they pass through different fire compartments, floors, and walls.
III. Lighting System
Light Source: LED is the primary light source used throughout the project.
Luminaire Parameters:
The light source color temperature is controlled between 3300K and 5300K.
The color rendering index (Ra) is not less than 80.
The power factor of the luminaires is not less than 0.9.
Control Method:
Residential lighting is controlled by a smart home system.
Public areas (lobbies, corridors, etc.) use an intelligent lighting system that allows for centralized, remote, or integrated control with the Building Automation (BA) system.
Stairwells and vestibules use sound and light-activated time-delay switches.
Offices, restrooms, etc., use local rocker switches.
Emergency Lighting:
A centralized power and control system for fire emergency lighting and evacuation signage is adopted.
The detailed design of this system will be commissioned to a specialized manufacturer by Party A.
IV. Lightning Protection, Grounding, and Safety
Lightning Protection Level: The building is designed and protected as a Class III lightning protection structure.
Air Terminal: A grid of 10mm galvanized steel rods is laid on the rooftop parapet, forming an air terminal network with a mesh size not exceeding 20m×20m or 24m×16m.
Down Conductor: Two diagonal main reinforcing bars (Φ16 or larger) within the building's structural columns are used as down conductors, with a spacing of no more than 25m.
Grounding System:
The rebar mesh of the building's foundation slab is used as the grounding electrode.
A common grounding system is used throughout the building, connecting lightning protection grounding, equipment protective grounding, and low-voltage system grounding. The combined grounding resistance is required to be no more than 1.0Ω.
Equipotential Bonding:
A Main Equipotential Bonding (MEB) terminal box is installed in the substation on the first basement level.
Local Equipotential Bonding (LEB) is implemented in restrooms.
Surge Protection Device (SPD):
Level 1: A Type 1 SPD is installed on the low-voltage busbar in the substation.
Level 2: A Type 2 SPD is installed in the floor distribution boxes.
Level 3: A Type 3 SPD is installed in the final distribution boxes for critical equipment.
V. Intelligent and Monitoring Systems
Fire Alarm System: The fire control center is located on the first basement level.
Leakage Fire Monitoring: A leakage fire monitoring system is installed to monitor the residual current in circuits. It will trigger an audible and visual alarm and transmit a signal to the fire control room in case of an anomaly.
Fire-fighting Equipment Power Monitoring: A power monitoring system for fire-fighting equipment is installed, with information transmitted to a dedicated display in the fire control room.
Conduit Reservation: Conduits are reserved in the first basement level for the introduction of civil air defense services, including telephone, cable TV, and surveillance lines.
VI. Electrical Energy Saving Measures
High-efficiency Equipment: Use of energy-efficient LED luminaires, SCB12 or higher grade energy-saving transformers, and high-efficiency electric motors.
Circuit Optimization: The substation is located as close as possible to the load center. Voltage drop is strictly controlled to be no more than 2% for main lines and 5% for branch lines.
Sub-metering: Separate metering for different types of loads such as power, air conditioning, lighting, and socket outlets, integrated into the power operation monitoring system.
Intelligent Control:
Elevators use high-efficiency motors and energy-saving control technology. Escalators are equipped with variable frequency and energy-saving control devices.
Group control energy-saving mode is used for two or more passenger elevators.
VII. Explosion-proof Design
Scope of Application: This design applies to hazardous areas with explosion risks within the project.
Equipment Selection: All lighting fixtures, switches, junction boxes, and control boxes are explosion-proof certified products.
Cable Laying: Thick-walled steel conduits (SC pipes) with a wall thickness of no less than 2.0mm are used for wiring.
Fire Separation: Isolation and sealing measures must be implemented where conduits pass through walls or floors separating areas with different hazard classifications.
Grounding: The metal enclosures of all electrical equipment in hazardous areas must be reliably grounded.
