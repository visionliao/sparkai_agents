LIV'N The SPARK — Q&A for Engineering
Q: Why can the central air conditioning only either heat or cool at the same time?
A: Because the community uses a central air conditioning system, the central system can usually only be set to one mode at a time. For example, during cooling, the refrigerant absorbs indoor heat and releases it outdoors; during heating, the refrigerant absorbs heat from the outdoors and releases it indoors. The two modes require the refrigerant to flow in opposite directions, so they cannot operate simultaneously.

Q: When does the central air conditioning switch to heating/cooling?
A: Summer — Generally, when the temperature exceeds 26 degrees Celsius for a continuous week, we will switch to summer cooling mode. (Recently, the temperature difference between day and night has been significant, so we have not switched yet).
Winter — If the maximum temperature is below 20 degrees Celsius for a continuous week, we will switch to winter heating mode.

Q: Why doesn't my daily air conditioning index match my actual usage?
A: The air conditioning billing system does not upload data in real-time. The energy meter takes time to upload data in batches. For example, the data uploaded on a given day may be the sum of the previous few days.

Q: Why is there an air conditioning charge even if I don't use it?
A: The central air conditioning system will normally have a slight natural loss due to water flow (the ventilation mode will also generate air conditioning units). If you do not need to use the air conditioning at all, you can contact us, and we will have the engineering team turn off the air conditioning water valve, after which there will be no more air conditioning energy index.

Q: I have a question about my water and electricity bills; they seem higher than my actual usage. What is going on?
A (Phase 1): We can help you export the data to check.
A (Phase 2): We can accompany a technician to check with you whether the readings on your apartment's independent water and electricity meters in the hallway are consistent with the system. (We can also come to your apartment to record the readings and then record them again after some time to see if they are normal).
A (Phase 3): After the technician's inspection, if your water and electricity meters are found to be functioning normally, you can also request a third-party inspection (which you can arrange or the community can arrange). If the inspection shows that the meter is functioning normally, you will be responsible for the cost of this inspection.

Q: I have a question about my air conditioning bill; it seems higher than my actual usage. What is going on?
A (Phase 1): We can help you export the data to check.
A (Phase 2): We can provide the national qualification certificate for the air conditioning meter. (We can also arrange for the manufacturer to come and check if it is normal).
A (Phase 3): After the technician's inspection, if your meter is found to be functioning normally, you can also request a third-party inspection (which you can arrange or the community can arrange). If the inspection shows that the meter is functioning normally, you will be responsible for the cost of this inspection.

Q: Why are there readings even when I don't use the air conditioning?
A: The community uses a water-cooled central air conditioning system. After the panel is turned on or off, water will continue to flow and will not stop immediately. It is normal to have some natural loss. If you do not use it for a long time (i.e., the air conditioning solenoid valve does not open), the readings will become 0-0-0.
