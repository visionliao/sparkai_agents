Detailed Layout Analysis of S-39 Room Type
1. Foyer (门厅)
Room Layout & Furnishings:
To the left of the entrance, there is a floor-to-ceiling shoe cabinet (labeled "SHOES"), providing ample storage space.
The flooring material may differ from other areas (as indicated by the grid pattern on the floor in the diagram), serving as a dust control zone.
Functional and Layout Analysis:
As the first space upon entering the home, the foyer's function is for changing shoes, placing items, and transitioning one's mood.
The layout here is very direct with a clear circulation path. After entering, one can go directly to the bathroom or into the main living and dining area. The shoe cabinet is practical and meets daily storage needs.
2. Bathroom (卫生间) & Utility Area
Room Layout & Furnishings:
The design of this area is a major highlight of the unit, featuring a highly efficient "three-part separation" layout.
Vanity Area (External): Separate from the wet area, it features a washbasin. Adjacent to it, space is reserved for a washing machine (labeled "WM") and a vacuum cleaner (labeled "vacuum cleaner"), forming a compact utility corner.
Toilet Area: Inside, there is a separate toilet room (labeled "TOILET").
Shower Area: There is an independent shower room (labeled "SHOWER"), separated from the outside by a glass door.
Functional and Layout Analysis:
"Three-Part Separation" Design: This is a very modern and user-friendly design. The three functions—washing up, using the toilet, and showering—can be performed simultaneously without interfering with each other. This greatly enhances efficiency, especially during peak morning and evening hours, making it very suitable for households with two or more people.
Wet/Dry Separation: The layout achieves a complete separation of wet and dry areas. The steam from the shower is fully contained, keeping the external vanity and utility areas dry and clean. This facilitates cleaning and prevents electrical appliances from being damaged by moisture.
3. Kitchen (K) & Dining Area (用餐区)
Room Layout & Furnishings:
Kitchen: It features a single-wall (I-shaped) open layout, including a sink (labeled "水" - water), a countertop for food preparation, and a stove (labeled "火" - fire). The cabinets provide basic storage.
Dining Area: Located next to the kitchen, it is furnished with a round dining table and two chairs.
Functional and Layout Analysis:
Integrated LDK: The Living, Dining, and Kitchen areas are combined into one, a typical design technique in small apartments to create a sense of spaciousness. This open layout reduces physical walls, making the entire public area appear more open and bright.
Smooth Circulation: The kitchen workflow of "washing, cutting, and cooking" is clear. After cooking, food can be served directly to the table, making the dining circulation short and efficient. The dining area acts as a natural transition between the kitchen and the living room.
4. Living Room (客厅)
Room Layout & Furnishings:
A three-seater sofa.
Two small, round coffee tables that can be flexibly arranged.
The opposite wall has a designated space for a TV or projector.
Functional and Layout Analysis:
As the core activity area of the home, the living room has a simple and open layout. The choice of furniture (small-volume coffee tables) prevents the space from feeling cluttered.
The sofa is not placed against a wall, leaving a corridor behind it that leads to the bedroom. This creates a circular circulation path, making the space more flexible.
5. Bedroom (卧室)
Room Layout & Furnishings:
A double bed measuring 1800×2000mm.
Two nightstands.
A full-wall closet (labeled "CLOSET"), providing substantial storage capacity.
The bedroom connects to a balcony or bay window area.
Functional and Layout Analysis:
The bedroom's functional zones are clear: a sleeping area (bed) and a storage area (closet).
The bed is well-placed, with sufficient passage space on both sides. Facing the balcony, it ensures good lighting and ventilation.
The full-wall closet is a classic method for maximizing storage in a small unit, meeting the owner's clothing storage needs.

Analysis of Plumbing System for S-39 Room Type (For Maintenance)
Plumbing System Overview:
1. Drainage System:
This is a pressurized (or gravity-fed) drainage system. Its main function is to collect wastewater from floor drains and various fixtures and effectively discharge it through pipes.
Pipe Specifications: "De" is used to indicate the outer diameter of the pipe in millimeters. De110 is typically used for the main drainage stack of the building, while De75 is used for horizontal branches connecting multiple fixtures.
Key Components & Symbols:
P-Trap: The symbol resembles a funnel with a "U"-shaped bend underneath. It is a critical component of the drainage pipeline. The water stored in the U-bend forms a "water seal," effectively preventing sewer gases and pests from entering the room.
System Numbering: Includes B-WL-8, B-FL-8, B-CFL-8. Here, 'B' may represent the building, and '8' may represent the floor (e.g., 8th floor). 'WL' refers to Waste Line, 'FL' refers to Floor Drain Line, and 'CFL' refers to Ceiling Floor Drain Line.
2. Water Supply System (Shown at the bottom of the diagram):
This system is responsible for distributing and supplying water to different points within the building.
Pipe Specifications: "DN" is used to indicate the nominal diameter of the pipe. Specific sizes include DN25, DN32, DN40, and DN50.
Installation Elevation:
FF+2.75: Indicates that the installation height of this pipe is 2.75 meters above the Finished Floor.
EL+2.55: Indicates its absolute elevation is +2.55 meters.
Key Components & Symbols:
Ground Symbol: Represented by a downward arrow connected to three horizontal lines, this symbol indicates the termination point of a pipe or its connection to the system's source.
Elevation Distribution Diagrams for S-39 Room Type (For Decoration and Maintenance)
Elevation 1
Left and Center (Cabinet System):
Upper Section (Wall Cabinets): Labeled WD 01 Light Gray Laminate, providing storage space at the top.
Middle Section (Work Area): This is the core functional area of the kitchen, including:
Countertop: Labeled ST 02 Artificial Stone, the main platform for food preparation.
Sink: The outline of an undermount sink is precisely drawn.
Backsplash/Wall: Labeled CT 05 Tiles, protecting the wall from grease and water splashes while also serving as an important decorative element.
Lower Section (Base Cabinets): Also using WD 01 Light Gray Laminate, this is the main storage space for kitchen utensils, pots, and pans.
Right Side (Tall Cabinet/Decorative Panel):
A tall cabinet or decorative wall panel labeled WD 01 Light Gray Laminate. Its vertical wood grain adds a sense of vertical stretch to the space and may conceal built-in appliances (like a refrigerator) or large storage compartments.
Structure and Finishing:
Top: A wall surface labeled PT 03 White Emulsion Paint and an MT 02 L-shaped Metal Trim Strip. The metal strip provides a refined and clean finish to the top of the wall cabinets.
Bottom: Labeled WD 05 Finished Skirting Board, which protects the wall base and completes the transition between the floor and the wall.
Elevation 2
Left Side - Wood Veneer and Hidden Door:
The area on the left of the elevation with a vertical wood grain corresponds to the exterior wall of the Bathroom (D03) on the floor plan.
The door, which is almost seamlessly integrated into the wall, is the Bathroom Door (D03) from the floor plan. This "hidden door" or "concealed door" design, where the door is completely blended into the decorative wall, is a common technique in modern minimalism. The faint outlines of the toilet and washbasin inside also confirm this.
Right Side - Diamond Pattern Wall:
The large area on the right of the elevation with a geometric diamond pattern corresponds to a functional wall in the Master Bedroom/Living Area on the floor plan, adjacent to the bathroom.
This section is not a glass partition but a set of large custom closets or storage cabinets. The cabinet doors also use WD 01 Light Gray Laminate and feature a decorative diamond pattern created with V-grooves or lines, combining storage functionality with aesthetic value.
Middle - Black Metal Strip:
The thin black line (MT 01) located between the wood veneer and the diamond-patterned cabinets marks the junction between the bathroom wall and the master bedroom wall on the floor plan. It serves as a clear visual separator.
Top and Bottom:
The light gray emulsion paint wall (PT 01) at the top and the wooden skirting board (WD 05) at the bottom run across the entire elevation, creating a unified top and base that harmonizes the different functional modules.
Elevation 3
Central Double Glass Doors:
This is a detailed design development from the previous floor plan information. Although the earlier plan only used symbols for walls and curtains, this detailed drawing clearly specifies that the core of the wall is a grand 2500mm wide double door.
Its transparent glass design indicates that the door's function is to establish a visual connection between two spaces (e.g., living room and study, or master bedroom and living area), serving to divide the space without obstructing the line of sight.
Curtains on Both Sides:
This perfectly corresponds to the curtain symbols drawn along the wall in the master plan. The detailed drawing shows the specific hanging method: they are symmetrically distributed on both sides of the door and elegantly tied back with straps, suggesting their functional opening and closing capabilities.
The curtains hang from a top recess (a concealed curtain box) and extend down to the floor, a design that enhances the vertical sense of the space.
Top and Bottom Structure:
The soffit/bulkhead above the door corresponds to the wall structure in the floor plan. Its main purpose is to hide the curtain track, making the overall visual appearance cleaner and more complete.
The finished skirting board (WD 05) at the bottom corresponds to the finishing treatment at the base of the wall.
Elevation 4
This wall's design is a symphony of materials, colors, and light, with various elements working together to form a rich yet unified whole.

Unified Tone:
PT 01 Light Gray Emulsion Paint: Serving as the main background color across all three zones, this neutral and soft gray seamlessly connects the spaces with different functions, creating visual continuity and a sense of unity.
Differentiated Zonal Design:
Bedroom Zone: The base under the bed uses MT 01 Black Matte Metal, creating a light, "floating" effect that is modern and sleek. The skirting boards on the sides are WD 05 Finished Skirting Boards.
Living Room Zone: The wall base in the sofa area uses ST 01 Artificial Stone. The use of this material subtly defines the living room area visually and enhances its sense of stability and quality.
Storage Cabinet Zone: This is the area with the richest mix of materials, a carefully designed "material collage."
Detailed Layout Analysis of S-35 Room Type
1. Foyer
Room Layout & Furnishings:
To the left of the entrance, there is a shoe cabinet (SHOES CABINET), with dimensions noted as W=820mm, providing basic entry storage.
Functional and Layout Analysis:
As a transitional area upon entry, the foyer's design is simple and clear. Though not large, the shoe cabinet meets the core need. The circulation path leads directly to the interior kitchen and living spaces, creating a clear flow.
2. Kitchen (厨房)
Room Layout & Furnishings:
Single-wall Kitchen Cabinet (KITCHEN CABINET): Arranged along the wall, it integrates storage, food preparation, and cooking functions. Although the stove is not explicitly drawn, its position is typically within the prep area.
Sink: Located in the middle of the cabinet run.
Closet: A closet is integrated next to the kitchen area. This is an unconventional but space-efficient approach that increases overall storage capacity.
Functional and Layout Analysis:
This is a typical open-plan kitchen, fully connected to the living and dining areas (which are combined), forming an expansive public activity zone (LDK - Living, Dining, Kitchen).
Advantage: It significantly enhances the sense of space in a small unit.
Disadvantage: Cooking fumes and noise may affect the entire living room and bedroom.
3. Living Room (客厅)
Room Layout & Furnishings:
Two-seater Sofa (SOFA / 沙发): The core piece of furniture in this area, defining its function for socializing and relaxation.
Refrigerator (Fridge) and Washer-Dryer Combo: These two appliances are cleverly recessed into a niche between the kitchen and the bathroom, creating an appliance zone.
Functional and Layout Analysis:
The living room serves as the central hub of the entire unit, connecting the circulation paths to the kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom.
The layout is very compact, without a separate TV console or coffee table, suggesting a space that may prioritize social interaction or a minimalist lifestyle.
Placing the refrigerator and washing machine outside the main kitchen work area is a strategy to save countertop space in the kitchen and centralize appliances.
4. Bedroom (寝室)
Room Layout & Furnishings:
Double Bed (BED / ベッド): Dimensions are noted as 1500x2000mm, a standard double bed size.
Nightstand (NIGHTSTAND / 小さな机): One on each side of the bed, measuring 450x450mm, providing convenient storage.
Closet: Located at the far end of the bedroom area, it works with the closet next to the kitchen to form the main clothing storage system.
Functional and Layout Analysis:
There is no physical wall or door separating the bedroom from the living room, creating a layout similar to a "studio" or "open-plan" apartment.
This design maximizes the sense of openness and natural light but sacrifices the bedroom's privacy and sound insulation. The bed is positioned facing the public area without any screening.
5. Bathroom System (Bathroom Area)
Room Layout & Furnishings:
The design of this area is a highlight, featuring an efficient, multi-part separated layout.
Vanity (VANITY / 化粧台): Set up independently in the "dry area," it is convenient for daily washing without affecting the use of the "wet area."
Independent Bathroom (BATHROOM / 浴室): This "wet area" contains the Toilet (TOILET / 便器) and Shower (SHOWER / 浴室).
Functional and Layout Analysis:
This design is a typical "wet/dry separation" layout. The vanity is placed outside, while the toilet and shower are combined inside.
Key Advantages:
Improved Efficiency: One person can use the vanity while another uses the toilet or shower, resolving usage conflicts during peak morning and evening hours.
Maintains Dryness and Hygiene: Steam is contained within the innermost shower area, keeping the external vanity and floor dry, which reduces bacterial growth and the risk of slipping.
Part Two: Overall Layout Summary and Analysis
1. Overall Layout and Circulation Evaluation
Zoning of Active and Quiet Areas: The separation between "active" and "quiet" zones in this unit is relatively blurred. The active zone (kitchen, living room) and the quiet zone (bedroom) are not strictly physically separated but are integrated. The bathroom, which requires the most privacy, is properly placed in a corner of the unit, out of the direct line of sight from the main resting area. This layout sacrifices traditional "quietness" in exchange for a sense of space and flexibility.
Internal Circulation: The circulation is smooth but has some intersections.
Upon entering from the foyer, two main circulation paths are formed:
Living Path: Foyer → Kitchen → Living Room → Bedroom.
Functional Path: Foyer → Appliance Zone (Fridge/Washer) → Bathroom.
The circulation design is efficient, with no wasted corridor space. However, getting from the kitchen to the refrigerator requires crossing a small part of the living space, which might slightly disturb someone resting on the sofa.
2. Outstanding Design Merits
Extreme Space Integration and Storage Planning: Within the limited space, the designer has maximized storage potential by creating a recessed appliance zone and incorporating multiple closets and cabinets. In particular, integrating appliances along a circulation path, while sacrificing some convenience, frees up valuable internal space in the kitchen and bathroom.
Sense of Space from an Open Layout: By opening up the kitchen, living room, and bedroom, the design creates a feeling of spaciousness and transparency that far exceeds the unit's actual square footage. For a single person or a couple, this openness and interactivity can significantly enhance the living experience.

Lighting Control Circuit Design Functional Description:

The whole-house lighting is controlled by wall switches with carefully planned circuits to enhance convenience, comfort, and safety.
Central Control Hub: The main control panel at the entrance (Foyer/Kitchen area) serves as the primary hub upon entering. It centralizes the circuits for the foyer, kitchen walkway, and kitchen counter lights, and includes an S/A switch. This switch may be a two-way or multi-way design, allowing users to light up the public areas upon entry and conveniently turn them off when leaving.
Bedside Convenience: The bedroom features independent bedside control. The two R01 adjustable downlights above the headboard are on a separate circuit from the main light, allowing users to turn off the overhead lights directly from the bed, creating a hotel-like comfortable experience and providing ideal lighting for reading at night.
Zoned Lighting Strategy: The entire house adopts a functional zoned lighting strategy, using a combination and grouped control of downlights, spotlights, and strip lights instead of a single main light. This achieves multiple functions:
Accent Lighting: Provided by the R01 adjustable downlights in the living room and bedroom to create visual focal points.
Task Lighting: Provided by the R05 light strip under the kitchen cabinets to ensure shadow-free food preparation.
Ambient Lighting: The soft, indirect light from the R05 strip light by the bedroom window and the R06 strip in the foyer cabinet enhances the spatial layering.
Safety Lighting: The dedicated R03 waterproof downlight in the wet shower area ensures electrical safety in a humid environment.

Whole-House Elevation Design Analysis Report for S-35 Room Type
"Elevation One" Detail Drawing
This elevation shows the complete wall surface as seen when standing in the kitchen/foyer area and looking towards the living room sofa and bedroom. It directly corresponds to the long wall between Axis 7 and Axis 8 on the master floor plan, which the sofa, nightstands, and bed are placed against.

Right Side - Folding Door:
Elevation View: On the right side of the drawing, the large element with a vertical texture, labeled LAMINATE FINISH and folding door.
Floor Plan View: This corresponds to the entrance/partition of the BEDROOM. On the floor plan, there is no traditional door in this location, but rather an open interface, which confirms the designer's intention to use a flexible folding door for space division. When the door is open, the living room and bedroom are integrated; when closed, they form separate, private spaces.
Center - Sofa & Background Wall:
Elevation View: The sofa in the center, the "art" (area for hanging artwork) above it, and the PT 01 Light Gray Emulsion Paint wall behind it.
Floor Plan View: This precisely corresponds to the LIVING ROOM area, where the sofa is positioned on the floor plan.
Left Side - Decorative Combination Zone:
Elevation View: The composite area on the left of the drawing, consisting of light gray laminate panels, a mirror, a low cabinet below, and a light gray emulsion paint wall.
Floor Plan View: This area corresponds to the wall space to the left of the sofa on the floor plan, near the exterior wall of the bathroom. Floor plans typically do not show movable or custom furniture, whereas the elevation drawing details the custom design of this wall section, serving as an extension of the living room's function and providing visual balance.
